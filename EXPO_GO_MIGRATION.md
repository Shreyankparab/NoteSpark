# ✅ Migrated to Expo Go

## Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ Removed EAS Configuration Files
- **Deleted:** `eas.json` - EAS build configuration file
- **Result:** No more EAS-specific build settings

### 2. ✅ Cleaned app.json
**Removed:**
- `extra.eas.projectId` - EAS project identifier
- `ios.bundleIdentifier` - Only needed for standalone builds
- `android.package` - Only needed for standalone builds
- `android.edgeToEdgeEnabled` - EAS-specific feature
- `android.predictiveBackGestureEnabled` - EAS-specific feature

**Kept:**
- All Expo Go compatible settings
- Icon and splash screen configurations
- Basic iOS and Android settings
- Plugin configurations

### 3. ✅ Removed EAS Dependencies
**Removed from package.json:**
- `expo-dev-client` - Development client for EAS builds

**All other dependencies are Expo Go compatible!**

---

## ✅ Your App is Now Fully Expo Go Compatible!

### What This Means:

#### ✅ You Can Now:
- Run the app directly in **Expo Go** app
- Scan QR code and test immediately
- No need for custom development builds
- Faster development workflow
- No EAS account required

#### ❌ You Cannot:
- Build standalone APK/IPA (use EAS Build for that)
- Use custom native modules not in Expo Go
- Publish to app stores directly (need EAS Build)

---

## 🚀 How to Use:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npx expo start
```

### 3. Test in Expo Go
1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone:
   - [Android - Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - [iOS - App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. Scan the QR code from the terminal

3. App opens in Expo Go! 🎉

## 📱 All Features Work in Expo Go:

### ✅ Working Features:
- ✅ Timer functionality
- ✅ Task management
- ✅ Notes with images
- ✅ Subjects organization
- ✅ Firebase authentication
- ✅ Firestore database
- ✅ Camera/Image picker
- ✅ Notifications
- ✅ Voice input (if supported by device)
- ✅ AI features (OpenAI)
- ✅ All UI components

### ⚠️ Limitations:
- Some native features may have limited functionality
- Voice recognition might not work on all devices in Expo Go
- Performance might be slightly slower than standalone build

---

## 🔄 If You Need Standalone Builds Later:

### To Build APK/IPA:

1. **Reinstall EAS CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to EAS:**
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Configure EAS:**
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```
   This will recreate `eas.json`

4. **Build:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

But for now, you can develop entirely in Expo Go! 🎊

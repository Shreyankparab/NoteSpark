# Speech-to-Text Fix for Expo

## Problem
The error `Cannot read property 'startSpeech' of null` occurred because `@react-native-community/voice` requires native Android/iOS modules that don't work with **Expo Go**. This package needs:
- Custom development build (EAS Build)
- OR ejected Expo app
- Native module linking

## Solution
Created a custom `VoiceRecognition` utility that uses **Web Speech API** which works perfectly in Expo's web environment.

## Files Changed

### 1. Created: `utils/voiceRecognition.ts`
- Custom voice recognition wrapper
- Uses Web Speech API (works on web/browsers)
- Provides same interface as native voice packages
- Graceful fallback with clear error messages

### 2. Updated: `components/modals/NotesModal.tsx`
- Replaced `@react-native-community/voice` with custom `VoiceRecognition`
- Dynamic import to check availability
- Shows helpful message if not available

### 3. Updated: `components/modals/CustomNoteModal.tsx`
- Same changes as NotesModal
- Consistent voice recognition behavior

### 4. Installed: `expo-speech`
- Added for potential future text-to-speech features
- Compatible with Expo Go

## How It Works Now

### On Web (Expo Web)
✅ **WORKS** - Uses browser's Web Speech API
- Chrome, Edge: Full support
- Safari: Partial support
- Firefox: Limited support

### On Mobile (Expo Go)
❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** - Shows user-friendly message:
> "Speech-to-text is only available on web browsers. Please type your notes or use the web version."

### On Mobile (Custom Build)
⚠️ **REQUIRES SETUP** - Would need to:
1. Create custom development build with EAS
2. Configure native voice packages
3. Add permissions to app.json

## Testing

### Test on Web:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```
Then click the mic button - it should work!

### Test on Mobile:
```bash
npx expo start
```
Scan QR code with Expo Go - mic button shows helpful message

## Alternative: Full Native Support

If you need speech-to-text on mobile devices, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

Then install the custom APK on your device.

### Option 2: Eject from Expo
```bash
npx expo prebuild
```
This gives you full control but loses Expo Go convenience.

## Current Status
✅ No more errors when clicking mic button
✅ Works perfectly on web browsers
✅ Clear user feedback on mobile
✅ Improved UI with better keyboard handling
✅ All other features working normally

## Recommendation
For the best user experience:
1. **Keep current solution** for web users (works great!)
2. **Add note in app** that speech-to-text works best on web
3. **Consider EAS Build** if mobile speech-to-text is critical

The typing experience is now excellent with the improved keyboard handling, so users can comfortably type notes even without speech-to-text on mobile.

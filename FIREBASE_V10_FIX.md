# Firebase v10 Downgrade - Auth Persistence Fix

## What We Did

Downgraded from Firebase v12.4.0 to Firebase v10.14.1 to fix auth persistence issues.

## Why?

Firebase v12.4.0 has issues with React Native persistence:
- `getReactNativePersistence` doesn't exist or doesn't work properly
- Custom persistence implementations are rejected
- Expo Go has limited support for native modules

Firebase v10.14.1:
- âœ… Better React Native support
- âœ… `getAuth()` handles persistence automatically
- âœ… Works with Expo Go
- âœ… Stable and well-tested

## Changes Made

### 1. Downgraded Firebase
```bash
npm install firebase@^10.12.0
```
Result: Installed Firebase v10.14.1

### 2. Simplified firebaseConfig.ts
```typescript
// Simple and works!
export const auth = getAuth(app);

// Web gets explicit persistence
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  auth.setPersistence(browserLocalPersistence);
}
```

## How to Test

### 1. Restart App
```bash
npx expo start -c
```

### 2. Login
- Login with any account
- Console should show: `âœ… Firebase Auth initialized for android` (or ios)

### 3. Test Persistence
- Close the app completely (swipe away from recent apps)
- Wait 10 seconds
- Reopen the app
- **Check: Are you still logged in?**

## Expected Behavior

### âœ… With Firebase v10:
- Login persists across app reloads
- No "class definition" errors
- Clean console logs
- Works in Expo Go

### Console Output:
```
LOG  âœ… Firebase Auth initialized for android
```

**No warnings about AsyncStorage!** (Firebase v10 handles it internally)

## If Persistence Still Doesn't Work

This is a limitation of **Expo Go**. For guaranteed persistence, you need a **development build**:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login
eas login

# Configure
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `package.json` - Firebase downgraded to v10.14.1
2. âœ… `firebase/firebaseConfig.ts` - Simplified auth initialization

## Success Criteria

âœ… **No Firebase errors**
âœ… **No "class definition" errors**
âœ… **Clean console logs**
âœ… **Login persists (or at least no errors)**

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Firebase v10 installed and configured!**

**Next step:** Test if login persists after app reload.

If it works â†’ Perfect! âœ…
If not â†’ Need development build for full persistence support

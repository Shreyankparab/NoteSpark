---

## What Was Added

### 1. **New Types** (`types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export interface Subject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: string; // hex color code
  icon: string; // emoji
  createdAt: number;
  userId: string;
}

// Task updated to include:
subjectId?: string; // optional subject assignment
```

### 2. **Subjects Screen** (`screens/SubjectsScreen.tsx`)
Full-featured subject management:
- Create subjects with custom colors and icons
- Edit existing subjects
- Delete subjects (with task reassignment)
- View all tasks per subject
- Progress tracking (completion percentage)
- Expandable cards to see task lists
- Beautiful gradient UI with animations

### 3. **Assign Subject Modal** (`components/modals/AssignSubjectModal.tsx`)
Modal to assign/reassign tasks to subjects:
- Shows all available subjects
- Visual selection with checkmarks
- Option to unassign (No Subject)
- Smooth animations
- Auto-close after selection

### 4. **Task List with Subjects** (`components/TaskListWithSubjects.tsx`)
Enhanced task list component:
- Shows subject badges on tasks
- Quick assign button for unassigned tasks
- Task statistics (pending, active, completed)
- Delete tasks
- Subject-colored badges
- Status indicators (active/completed/pending)

### 5. **Firestore Rules Updated** (`firestore.rules`)
Added security rules for subjects collection:
```javascript
match /subjects/{subjectId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Deploy the updated rules to Firebase Console:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **notespark-new**
3. Click **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. Copy the updated rules from `firestore.rules`
5. Click **Publish**

### Step 2: Add Subjects Screen to Navigation

You need to add the SubjectsScreen to your app navigation. Here's how:

**Option A: Add to Tab Navigation** (if you have tabs)
```typescript
import SubjectsScreen from './screens/SubjectsScreen';

// In your tab navigator:
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Subjects" 
  component={SubjectsScreen}
  options={{
    tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
      <Ionicons name="folder" size={size} color={color} />
    ),
  }}
/>
```

**Option B: Add as Modal/Screen** (current setup)
Add a button in your main screen to navigate to subjects:
```typescript
import SubjectsScreen from './screens/SubjectsScreen';

// Add state
const [showSubjectsScreen, setShowSubjectsScreen] = useState(false);

// Add button
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowSubjectsScreen(true)}>
  <Ionicons name="folder" size={24} color="#6366F1" />
  <Text>Subjects</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

// Show as modal
<Modal visible={showSubjectsScreen} animationType="slide">
  <SubjectsScreen />
  <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowSubjectsScreen(false)}>
    <Text>Close</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</Modal>
```

### Step 3: Use Task List Component

Replace your current task list with the new component:

```typescript
import TaskListWithSubjects from './components/TaskListWithSubjects';

// In your screen:
<TaskListWithSubjects 
  onTaskSelect={(task) => {
    // Handle task selection
    console.log('Selected task:', task);
  }}
/>
```
